# Node_JS_PDF_Generator

* Created variables to require fs, axios, inquirer, and html-pdf.

* began with a prompt that asked the user for their favorite color, followed by a prompt asked them to submit their GitHub username.

* Created a function that took the clients username and favorite color and ran the username info through the GitHub API using axios.

* After retrieving the data then created variables that would display the users: name, profile image, username, a link their GitHub, and a link to their linked profile, their github bio, public repos, followers, and how many people they are following. 

* After that created a function similar to the mini project that would display all this data onto an HTML page

* Created a variable that would generate the HTML and also an (err) function that would show an error message and what was wrong in the console.log

* Lastly used information from the generated HTML page to create the PDF
